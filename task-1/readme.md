Hi Team,

Here I have developed simple Flask application to test the sorting functionality.
Input-form.html is a simple HTML file where we can enter value, upon click of submit this will produce the result.
I have written a Docker file which can be used to build and test this app.

Build container with the above image

Upon success, access the container on the host ip with default port 80
** I have not added any validation to control the user input, I assume we enter valid value.
